# **Vidly React App**

---

This is a movie sorting app I built using React, as an exercise in the "React With Mosh"
course that I took.

It is not hosted yet.

To view the app, follow these steps:

1. ### Fork the repository

2. ### Clone your forked repository

   `git clone https://github.com/Generalsoi/vidly.git`

3. ### Install the needed node modules using the following code:

   `npm install`

4. ### To view the app in your local computer, use the following code:

   `npm start`

5. ### To contribute, add your code, and then push back to your forked repo.

6. ### Create a pull request, and I will review and merge.

Thank you.
